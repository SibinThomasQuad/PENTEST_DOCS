Developing an antivirus program is a complex task that requires expertise in various fields, including cybersecurity, malware analysis, and software development. Building a comprehensive virus detection database is just one aspect of creating an antivirus solution. Here's a general outline of the steps you would need to take:

1. **Form a Skilled Team**: Assemble a team of cybersecurity experts, malware analysts, and software developers. This team should have a strong understanding of malware and security.

2. **Define Objectives**: Clearly define the objectives and scope of your antivirus software. Determine what types of threats your antivirus will target (e.g., viruses, Trojans, ransomware, adware) and on what platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS).

3. **Gather Malware Samples**: Acquire a diverse and up-to-date collection of malware samples. You can obtain malware samples from public malware repositories, research institutions, or via partnerships with cybersecurity organizations. Ensure that you have the necessary legal permissions to collect and store these samples.

4. **Analyze Malware Samples**: Your team will need to perform detailed malware analysis to understand how different types of malware operate. This analysis will help in creating detection patterns and signatures.

5. **Create Detection Signatures**: Develop detection signatures, which can be based on file characteristics, behavior, or network communication patterns. These signatures will be used to identify and classify malware.

6. **Use Machine Learning**: Consider incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques for more advanced threat detection. Machine learning models can help identify new, unknown threats based on behavioral patterns.

7. **Implement Scanning Engine**: Build the scanning engine that will be the core of your antivirus. This engine will analyze files, processes, and network traffic for signs of malware.

8. **Update Mechanism**: Develop a mechanism to regularly update your antivirus with new malware signatures and detection rules. Timely updates are crucial to staying effective against emerging threats.

9. **User Interface**: Create a user-friendly interface for your antivirus software to allow users to configure settings, scan for threats, and review the results.

10. **Testing and Quality Assurance**: Thoroughly test your antivirus software in controlled environments and simulate real-world scenarios. Ensure it doesn't produce false positives or negatives.

11. **Legal and Ethical Considerations**: Be aware of legal and ethical considerations surrounding malware research and antivirus software development. Ensure compliance with relevant laws and regulations.

12. **Distribution and Updates**: Plan how you will distribute your antivirus software and provide updates to users.

13. **Support and Maintenance**: Set up a support system for users who may encounter issues or need assistance.

14. **Continuous Research**: Stay updated on the latest threats and continuously improve your antivirus software to adapt to new attack techniques and malware strains.

Building an antivirus solution is a significant undertaking that requires extensive resources and expertise. Additionally, be aware that the antivirus industry is highly competitive, and established antivirus companies invest heavily in research and development. You will need to consider how your solution will differentiate itself in the market.
