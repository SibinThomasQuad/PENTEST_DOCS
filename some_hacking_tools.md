Hacking tools come in various categories and serve different purposes, from penetration testing to vulnerability scanning. Below is a list of hacking tools and their common usages:

1. **Metasploit**:
   - Usage: Exploitation and penetration testing. It offers a wide range of exploits and payloads for testing the security of systems.

2. **Nmap (Network Mapper)**:
   - Usage: Network discovery and vulnerability scanning. Nmap identifies open ports, services, and operating systems on networked systems.

3. **Wireshark**:
   - Usage: Packet analysis and network troubleshooting. Wireshark captures and inspects data packets in real-time.

4. **Burp Suite**:
   - Usage: Web application security testing. Burp Suite helps discover vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, and CSRF.

5. **OWASP ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy)**:
   - Usage: Web application security testing and vulnerability scanning, including automated and manual testing.

6. **Aircrack-ng**:
   - Usage: Wireless network security testing. Aircrack-ng is used for assessing the security of Wi-Fi networks and cracking WEP/WPA/WPA2 keys.

7. **John the Ripper**:
   - Usage: Password cracking. John the Ripper is used to identify weak passwords by brute force and dictionary attacks.

8. **Hydra**:
   - Usage: Password cracking tool for performing online password attacks using various protocols.

9. **Ghidra**:
   - Usage: Reverse engineering and analyzing software. Ghidra helps analyze malware and applications.

10. **WiFite**:
    - Usage: Automated Wi-Fi network penetration testing tool. It automates tasks like deauthentication attacks and capturing handshakes for WPA/WPA2 cracking.

11. **Nikto**:
    - Usage: Web server vulnerability scanner. Nikto checks web servers for common security issues.

12. **Sqlmap**:
    - Usage: Automated SQL injection tool. Sqlmap is used to detect and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

13. **Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)**:
    - Usage: Social engineering attacks and testing. SET provides tools for phishing, spear-phishing, and other social engineering attacks.

14. **Cain and Abel**:
    - Usage: Password recovery and network sniffing. Cain and Abel can crack password hashes and perform man-in-the-middle attacks.

15. **Hashcat**:
    - Usage: Password recovery and hash cracking. Hashcat supports various hashing algorithms.

16. **Maltego**:
    - Usage: Open-source intelligence (OSINT) tool for gathering and visualizing information about people, organizations, and relationships.

17. **BeEF (The Browser Exploitation Framework)**:
    - Usage: Browser-based exploitation and control. BeEF is used to exploit and control web browsers.

18. **Snort**:
    - Usage: Network intrusion detection system (NIDS). Snort helps monitor and detect suspicious network activities.

19. **Xplico**:
    - Usage: Network packet capture and analysis tool. Xplico extracts data from network traffic.

20. **Cuckoo Sandbox**:
    - Usage: Malware analysis and dynamic analysis. Cuckoo Sandbox is used to analyze and examine suspicious files.

Please note that while these tools can be valuable for legitimate purposes like penetration testing and security research, using them without proper authorization or for malicious activities is illegal and unethical. Always ensure that you have the necessary permissions and follow ethical guidelines when using hacking tools.
