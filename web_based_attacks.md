Certainly, here are brief definitions for the common web-based attacks mentioned in the previous list:

1. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**:
   - XSS is a vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal data, manipulate content, or perform other malicious actions on the victim's behalf.

2. **SQL Injection (SQLi)**:
   - SQLi occurs when an attacker inserts malicious SQL statements into input fields or URLs, tricking the application into executing unauthorized database queries. This can result in data exposure or manipulation.

3. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**:
   - CSRF is an attack that forces an authenticated user to perform actions on a web application without their consent. Attackers exploit the trust relationship between the user and the application.

4. **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Attacks**:
   - CORS attacks exploit misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing settings to access restricted resources on a different domain, potentially compromising user data.

5. **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection**:
   - XXE is a vulnerability that allows attackers to exploit insecure XML processing by injecting malicious entities, leading to data disclosure, server-side request forgery, and other attacks.

6. **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**:
   - SSRF enables attackers to make internal network requests, possibly accessing sensitive resources and causing security breaches.

7. **Remote File Inclusion (RFI) and Local File Inclusion (LFI)**:
   - RFI and LFI vulnerabilities allow attackers to include and execute remote or local files in web applications, often leading to unauthorized access or code execution.

8. **Directory Traversal (Path Traversal)**:
   - Directory traversal attacks manipulate file paths to access files and directories outside the intended scope, potentially revealing sensitive data.

9. **Security Misconfigurations**:
   - Security misconfigurations arise from poor or lax security settings, such as open directories, default credentials, or overly permissive file permissions.

10. **Insecure Deserialization**:
    - Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities permit attackers to manipulate serialized data to execute arbitrary code, potentially compromising the application.

These definitions provide a brief overview of each attack type. Understanding these terms is essential for identifying, preventing, and mitigating web-based security risks.
