When using these tools:

- **Integration with CI/CD:** Integrate static code analysis tools into your continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to catch issues early in the development process.

- **Custom Configuration:** Configure the tools based on your project's specific requirements, and adjust rule sets as needed.

- **Regular Updates:** Keep the static code analysis tools up to date to benefit from the latest security checks and improvements.

Remember, while automated tools are powerful, they are not a substitute for thorough manual code reviews and other security measures. Combining automated tools with manual reviews and other security practices provides a more comprehensive approach to securing your code.
